=========================

2.6.0
	- Added new functions:
		file
			get_cur_material_wildcard - a version of get_cur_material which allows wildcards on model names and returns a different structure.
				- this was made a separate function so that users of get_cur_material don't need to change their code to handle the new return object.
			import_file - imports PV, STEP, IGES, and NEUTRAL files
			list_materials_wildcard - a version of list_materials which allows wildcards on model names and returns a different structure.
				- this was made a separate function so that users of list_materials don't need to change their code to handle the new return object.

		bom
			get_paths - handle nested Simplified Reps
			          - return has_simprep flag to indicate whether model has a Simplified Rep
		connection
			is_creo_running - if a Creo exception occurs, return false rather than returning the error

			         - fix bug where unnamed children were not being suppressed (Issue #46)
		file
			assemble - fix bug where package_assembly flag was being ignored

		file
			get_active - when the active model is a MFG model, the function will return two file names; the second
